# Holomat Calibration & Jarvis AI Assistant

Inspired by [ConceptBytes' Holomat](https://github.com/Concept-Bytes/Holomat)

This repository contains two main components:

1. **Calibration Scripts** – Python scripts to perform camera calibration for the Holomat project using a Charuco board and 4-point calibration via OpenCV contours.
2. **Jarvis AI Assistant** – A voice-activated assistant inspired by Iron Man’s Jarvis. It leverages OpenAI (and a local Ollama-based model) for conversational capabilities and controls smart devices via voice commands.
